## This is a series of scripts, daemons and configurations I use on my home-server or across my other linux devices.
I started a home server to deepen my understanding of concepts learned during university lectures, practice and have fun.
I now host a few services to be independent, have my own space and backups, and because it is enjoyable.
Currently, I'm mantaining it, and evolving it to a more cybersecurity-focused lab, periodically adding monitoring and automation scripts and solutions.

The `daemons` directory includes systemd unit files, timers and executable:
- `update-system`: provides a simple service to update the system;
- `update-services`: contains scripts to update my services, such as immich, filebrowser and vaultwarden;
- `network-watchdog`: my home wifi service is very unstable, my server may become unreachable if it fails to reconnect after a network issue. This services looks for connection problems and restart the networking service

The `services` directory contains configuration files for self-hosted services, such as:
- `osquery`: SQL-based system-monitoring tool; in this directory are provided configuration and flag file for the osquery daemon. For further information, please visit the official website (osquery.io) or repository (`osquery/osquery`).
- `Wireguard`: here you can find example configuration files for both wireguard VPN client and server. In the server subdirectory two configuration files are proposed: the first for contains rules to only accept packets directed only to the server itself; the second one is more complex, and permits traffic forwarding;
 
Please note that the configurations and scripts provided in this repository need to be changed and adapted to your personal environment.
